# AWS PartyRock Daily Task Scheduler Application
A beginner-friendly AI application built using **AWS PartyRock** and powered by **AWS Bedrock**, designed to help users create optimized daily schedules while showcasing prompt engineering, generative AI workflows, and cloud-native deployment.

## Architecture Overview
This application is hosted entirely on the AWS PartyRock platform, which abstracts away backend infrastructure while allowing prompt engineering and UI customization.

*Figure 1: High-level architecture of the AWS PartyRock Daily Task Scheduler Application.*

**Core Components**
- **User Browser (Client)** – Interacts via HTTPS and renders the PartyRock web UI.
- **AWS PartyRock Platform** – Hosts the application, processes prompts, orchestrates AI models, and automatically scales infrastructure.
- **AWS Bedrock Models** – Generate schedules, motivational quotes, and images based on user inputs.
- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure (Managed)** – Networking, scaling, and compute are handled entirely by AWS PartyRock.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Designing and implementing generative AI application workflows.
- Creating multi-step AI processes using prompt chaining.
- Customizing user interfaces within managed AI platforms.
- Deploying applications using no-code/low-code AWS services.

## Features
- AI-generated daily schedules that respect user time boundaries and priorities.
- Motivational quotes and AI-generated images for user inspiration.
- Interactive scheduling assistant for personalized guidance.
- Shareable via public PartyRock link for collaboration and remixing.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** N/A (no-code implementation)
- **AWS Services:** PartyRock, Bedrock
- **IaC Tools:** N/A (managed service)
- **Other Tools:** None

## Deployment Instructions
*This project does not include an AWS CloudFormation or Terraform template, as AWS PartyRock is a fully managed service and abstracts away backend infrastructure.*

## How to Use
1. Open the live application: [Daily Task Scheduler Application](https://partyrock.aws/u/patrick-heese/Q3yFX5XnU/Daily-Task-Scheduler-Application).
2. Enter your tasks and priorities.
3. Click **Play** to generate your schedule.
4. (Optional) Use **Snapshot** to share results or **Remix** to create a custom version.

## Future Enhancements
- **Custom AWS Application** – Rebuild the PartyRock functionality using API Gateway, Bedrock, and Lambda for more control and customization.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code** – Use CloudFormation or Terraform to provision a reproducible environment.
- **Data Persistence** – Store generated schedules in DynamoDB or S3 for history tracking.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering** – Refine and test prompt strategies for more tailored outputs.
